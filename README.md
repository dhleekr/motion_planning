# pybullet-planning (previously ss-pybullet)

A repository of [PyBullet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybullet) utility functions for robotic motion planning, manipulation planning, and task and motion planning (TAMP).
This repository was originally developed for the [PDDLStream](https://github.com/caelan/pddlstream) (previously named [STRIPStream](https://github.com/caelan/stripstream)) approach to TAMP.

<!-- ## PyBullet Planning -->

With the help of [Yijiang Huang](https://github.com/yijiangh), a stable and documented fork of **pybullet-planning** named [pybullet_planning](https://github.com/yijiangh/pybullet_planning) is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pybullet-planning/).
However, new features will continue to be introduced first through **pybullet-planning**.
